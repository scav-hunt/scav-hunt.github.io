        <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>

<p><strong><em>This document is intended to address behaviors that the Judgeship will not tolerate and modes of recourse and possible in-Scav consequences for such behaviors. This is in addition to the guidelines set out by the Rules of the Hunt and University policy.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="section-1-responsibility">Section 1: Responsibility</h2>
<p>It is expected that no participant of The Great Hunt, Judge or otherwise, will exhibit gross misconduct or behavior that is inappropriately detrimental to Scavvies, Judges, outsiders, or Scav Hunt as a whole. Some examples of inappropriate behavior specifically targeted by this policy include, but are not limited to: hazing, bullying, harassment, discrimination, aiding and abetting, collusion, sabotage, and inappropriately making the Hunt worse for others. Such behavior can take place in public Scav spaces like events, in intra- and inter-team interactions, and/or in forums such as the Discord and email listhosts. Note that “being an unlikeable prick” does not <em>necessarily</em> fall under this rule, but it can at the discretion of the Judges.</p>

<h2 id="section-2-our-domain">Section 2: Our Domain</h2>
<p>The Judge Cabal serves to facilitate the Scav Hunt, and while we hope all Scavvies have a wonderful time, our reach and power is limited, particularly with regard to conflicts within teams or between individual Scavvies. It is the Judgeship’s responsibility to deal with misconduct by Judges; for misconduct by Scavvies, the Judges are only one recourse of several. There are existing resources that are more empowered to deal with shit than we are.</p>

<h2 id="section-3-appropriate-channels">Section 3: Appropriate Channels</h2>

<h3 id="section-3-a-things-we-the-judges-would-like-to-know-about">Section 3-A: Things We (The Judges) Would Like to Know About</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Misconduct (as defined in Section 1) that occurs without Judges present</li>
  <li>Misconduct by Judges</li>
</ul>

<p>An elder Judge who is not judging Items in the Hunt is responsible for handling Code of Conduct violations. They can be contacted at <a href="mailto:scavcodeofconductjudge@gmail.com">scavcodeofconductjudge@gmail.com</a>. If you are attempting to report a Code of Conduct violation by that very same Judge, contact the Head Judge instead. For reasons of impartiality, reports to other Judges will be redirected.</p>
