%Hello future Keepers of the Scrolls! I would suggest keeping all of these packages for ease of future Keepers, even if your List does not require these specific packages. If you do not have these packages downloaded, just run this code anyway and a window should pop up informing you that you don't have the package and asking you if you want to download it. You should then download the package and continue until you have all of the packages here downloaded. It doesn't take that much time.%

\section*{SCAV TEAMS AND THE RULES OF THE HUNT}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Acquisition of Items. All Items on the List can be obtained and performed legally. It may involve smooth talking, or it may involve something else, but it is all possible. The Judges take no responsibility for your getting thrown into the clink---be it local clink, state clink, federal clink, or Colonel Klink. If you end up there, it is your fault.

\item Fair Play. Sabotage is bad. We don't like it, and we don't want it in the Hunt. Sabotaging teams or their Items can lead to immediate disqualification, and we may even loose the hounds of the Administration on you. We expect all participants to abide by the Code of Conduct, which can be found on our website.

\item Contact with Judges. While we don't want to complain and say that Judges have it \emph{so} tough, Scav Hunt is always teetering on the edge of sheer chaos, and if we can avoid it, we should. Thus, please only communicate with the Judges if you are going to do it in a professional manner. Generally, just remember that the more people shout, the less will be understood. That seems like it makes sense,~no?

\item Props. All props must, always and forever, be mad props.

\item Points. Point totals are final. We ask you to do awesome things and expect awesome things to be done. If you do said awesome things, the Judge will accord to you Full Points, the highest number of points possible for any Item. In rare cases---for example, if we ask for a car and you give us the Batmobile with both George Clooney \emph{and} Adam West inside---we will consider giving you one special point. Maybe two. As far as point values, well, we use a dartboard, numberwang, and Tibetan numerological methods to determine how much Items are worth, so no complaining that ``the lazy eye patch was worth more than the moonbounce made of guns!''

\item Items. Be aware that doing Items nude when it's not explicitly asked for will not get you more points. Nor will involving alcohol in Items that don't clearly call for alcohol. The same goes for alcohol's redheaded, stepchild cousins, sex and drugs.  Please note that few Items explicitly call for nudity, alcohol, or either of the aforementioned redheaded variants. Lastly, we don't like to harm large mammals that can make sad eyes at us, so please treat any non-humans involved in your Items with extreme care.

\item  A Good Time.  For a good time call (202)~762-1401.

\item Preliminary Events. The deadlines for the submission of Items and performances are final as stated on the List or as announced by the Judges at ESC (Encountering Scav Captains), which happens at 9:00 a.m. on Thursday in Hutch Commons. It is the Captains' responsibility to make sure that they submit these in a timely manner. Items that do not have a discrete time/place stated on the List are not preliminary and therefore must occur at Judgment. Upon request, we may, at our discretion, come to see an Item at a time/place other than Judgment. Consider this a privilege, and use your ``Come See Our Items'' cards sparingly.

\item Digital Items. If an item is followed by \textleaf, it must be uploaded to \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x7-JnlKem2LTp2UmHd899xbTdwMGbSMR?usp=sharing}{this drive} by 9:00 p.m. on Saturday. Only submissions following the file naming convention of “PAGE \#. ITEM \#. TEAM NAME.” will be accepted.

\item Judgment Day.
As in the Bible, Judgment Day should take, like, 45 minutes. Scav is Hell, however, so be prepared to wait. Regular Items will be judged after the Showcase. The Showcase will be judged at Showcase, which will be at 10:00 a.m.

In addition, please have a highlighted list of the Items you've acquired ready so that when a Judge comes by to judge your page, there won't be any time wasted with ``do we have the particle accelerator?'' questions. If an Item is followed by $\dagger$, it must be ready for judging as part of the Showcase, prior to regular page judging. Judges will hold up placards (really just sheets of paper with Sharpie-ed numbers) denoting which pages they are ready to judge. Call over whichever Judge corresponds to the page you are ready to present. Here's a tip: sort your Items based on which page they are on. In short, BE ORGANIZED.

\item Rules. Ain't no rule says Adam Cole Bay Bay can't be a Judge.

\item Prizes. Depending on how much of the Scav budget the Judge Cabal hasn't spent on Choles for our holes, you may be eligible for a free-food bacchanal or other in-kind prize. Offer void where prohibited. Check local laws.

\item Decisions. All decisions of the Judges are final. Final.

\item Final. See Decisions.

%<><><><><><><><><><><>LATEX CODE YOU MIGHT NEED<><><><><><><><><><><><><>%

%     \graphicspath{ {C:/Users/Erin/Google Drive/LaTeX Stuff/} } = specifying the graphics path. I included the path I used to locate the graphics in my computer. Include this before the first graphic you include. If you include more in the same graphic path later, you do not need to type in this code again. If you take from a different folder, you'll have to do this code again for the new path. It's easiest to just put all graphics in the same folder and just type this once.
%     \includegraphics[width=15.5cm, height=3cm]{} = inserting graphics. You can change the width and height. Insert the name of the image inside the curly brackets.
%     \textit{} = italicized (put words you want italicized inside curly brackets)
%     \textbf{} = bold text
%     \underline{} = underline text
%     \textsuperscript{} = superscript text
%     \textsubscript{} = subscript text
%     \textsuperscript{\textregistered} = registered trademark (®)
%     \textsuperscript{TM} = Trademark OR
%     \texttrademark = Trademark (styled differently)
%     \' = acute accent over the letter that follows
%     Greek letters follow this format: $\Sigma$ = capital sigma symbol, $\sigma$ = lowercase sigma symbol
%     \url{} = link where text is the url (put URL inside curly brackets)
%     \href{}{} = hyperlink where text that appears is not the URL. Put URL inside first set of curly brackets, put text that you want to function as the link in the second set of curly brackets
%     \textasciitilde = tilde (not on letter)
%     \~ = tilde over following letter
%     \% = percent sign without starting a note
%     \# = text pound sign #
%     (In general for symbols that mean some sort of code in LaTeX, just include \ before them and you're probably good)
%     Putting dollar signs before and after text puts that text into Math Mode. You'll have to do this for Greek letters and the like
%     $\dagger$ = dagger (For showcase)
%     $\rightarrow$ = right pointing arrow
%     \newline = new line
%     $\blacksquare$ = blacksquare (good for blackout poetry type stuff

Minimum 3 paintings, maximum 6.]

\item Cream of Tomato on a Van Gogh? Liquid Mashed Potatoes on a Monet? As self-proclaimed art historians, we can say that these climate activists failed to honor the artistry with their inability to match these famous works to their proper soup.

\item Biblically accurate angel food cake. [Be 9 afraid points]

\item A live rotifer. [Roti4 points]
\item Get a kindergartener to explain to us what's going on in the gatefold of \textit{Tarkus}. [4.5-year-old points]
\item Transform a collectible game card into 3D cut-out art. But nothing so mainstream as \textit{Magic} or \textit{Yu-Gi-Oh!}, we’re looking for something a bit more out of the ordinary. Your choice of game, but to qualify, game must have been discontinued for over a decade and have had fewer than 500 released cards. [10 points]
\item Produce evidence that \UofC\ construction project manager Krystal McDoom plans to blast the 61st Street parking garage into outer space, and with it that accursed Richards! [3 points]

\item Tortillas that reveal an uncomfortable truth about the person judging this page. [3.5 points]
\item Do some cartwheels. You will have one minute. [1 point per full rotation, No goddamn limit. But must be performed, uninterrupted, by a single team member.]
\item Cloudwatch. On Friday at 4:00 p.m., meet us on the Midway just west of the skating rink. [$\gamma$ points]
\item Many would argue Tyra’s pun-filled interview with Beyoncé went on way too long. We, however, believe it did not go on long enough! Beyoncé-pun-off, smizing every step of the way. [3 points for participation, 7/5/3 bonus points for 1\st/2\nd/3\rd]
\item Don’t you want to make a toast? From evening until morning! Close out and begin each of the Fourdays with original toasts dedicated to your team, team members, or various and sundry comparable worthies, and present to us at Judgment an illuminated compilation of all toasts created thereby, in the style of \textit{Clark’s Original Songs, Recitations, \&c., \&c., Toasts \& Sentiments.} [5.5 \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{min}ポイント\end{CJK}]

\item Guess my SSN. [1.359-04-1987 points per correct number and placement]
\item Reimagine \textit{The Battle of the Fruit and Vegetable Soldiers} (Darwin, circa 1800s) in the static medium of your choice. We're looking for action, intrigue, and a newfound artistic vision. Let this piece be your muse. [I think… this is worth 5 points]
\item Before the advent of keyboards, typewriters were the word processors of choice. Ergo, before the advent of \textit{keyboards, typewriters} were the electronic musical instruments of choice. Duh! Make sure your lookalike Underwood or Hermes puts the likes of Casio or Yamaha to shame, dog barks and presets required. [23.5 points]
\item The new, healthier snack from Ferrero: it’s the Kinder® Avocado! It’s basically a regular-ass avocado, but they’ve somehow seamlessly replaced the boring ball inside with another amazing prize! [4.5 points]
\item Alfred Hitchcock's \textit{The Birbs}. [2 points]
\item TBA. [5 points] %ice cream truck
\item It’s time for Scav Hunt to contribute to science!

\item Look, man, we know it was stupid to bet that much money that ‘Aja Kong’ was the name of a \textit{Mario} franchise character whose defining trait is being really into Steely Dan. In my defense, the guy at the next barstool was being real fuckin’ obnoxious. And how were we supposed to know Aja Kong was, honest to god, a Japanese professional wrestler? But we bought some time---we told him the character was designed but never included in a game, just showed up in one of those Supper Mario Broth posts. So dude, if you can make a convincing character sheet, we’ll owe you big time. Least we could do is give you [3 points].

\item Photo evidence of a Garfield shrine at the Garfield station with a teammate present for a lasagna-filled worship. [Lasa9na points, 15 bonus points for a shrine shout-out from Jim Davis]
\item For this year’s Scavvenfeast, the theme is the failure of the financial system. Is it crude to make oil jokes now? For starters, the Fed wants their appetizer as high as the current interest rates---at least 10cm in height. Make sure that the appetizer’s variation in height reflects your chosen stock’s performance since the start of the Hunt. The main course, representing the fall of the Silicon Valley Bank, shall be hidden inside a perfect edible cube, which, after an elaborate presentation, will break to reveal perfectly edible coins. Finally, there is nothing as sweet as the forced monopolization of the Swiss bank system. To reflect the merger between Credit Suisse and UBS, please prepare a solely two-ingredient dessert in which each ingredient is present in three different preparation methods. Arranged bank marriage has never been this delightful! And seriously, do NOT forget to use an ingredient for each letter in “stonkz.” No finance major should feel like their efforts have gone to waste.

Complete with original animation, the hat should be able to slide down over our eyes where we can see the zoetrope in action, but the hat still, of course, must still be stylish to an outside observer.

To ensure it is not spotted, camouflage the intel with an ugly carpet pattern that matches the location it is secreted.]
\item The Weather Channel’s 2006 Storm Alert theme did not have to go that hard. Why did they compose it like it's the hurricane's boss music? But seeing as how they did, create the striking, dramatic cutscene which introduces this hypothetical hurricane-themed boss fight. [15\textdegree F points]

\item We, the Judgeship’s designated CS snobs, are dismayed to see that the University has changed the CS core sequence from its previous state in the name of “relevant skills” and “accessibility” and “why are you teaching Haskell to first years?” Please, help us fix the gaps in these unfortunate first-year’s educations by providing a “category theory is cool” video, a la Bill Nye. Good completions should make sure to introduce functors and endomorphisms, cover monadic composition, and do so with the appropriate wacky antics, zany effects, and stylish bowtie.
