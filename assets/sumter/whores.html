** To the future KOTS:
** This website was designed as an easy-to-revamp basic template.  I mean, this shit is used for about a week a year.  Fuck it, right?
** I figured that I might as well whip up some template page that can easily be modified using CSS and basic HTML.
** You can add whatever lame theme you have using only the CSS and messing around with images.
** I request that if you decide to change this page in the future, you toss the template and all the files somewhere in the directory.
** You know, just in case your theme sucks dick and a future-future-KOTS wants to revert to this easy-peasy template in the future.
** No really, have you seen the past sites?  Fuckin' awful, oh Jesus.
** Your loving Keeper of the Light, Ezalor.
** PS: Yes, you were preceeded by a huge DOTA nerd.

** Thanks to Yamazaki for the template which I totally stole, but it was free so whatever. And thanks to Kevin Houtz, who fixed like all this shit.

            <p>Over the hills of PVC piping a hideous shape appeared: a girl, dyed, spectacled, cloaked in stripes.  Slowly, trampling the pallets, she strode forth, heeding no longer any items.  She halted and held up a long pale notebook.  And as she did so a great fear fell on all, judge and team member alike; and the hands of Scavvies dropped to their sides, and no drill whirred.</p>
            <p>In strode the Lord of the H&ucirc;nt.  A great scarved shape against the tarps she loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair.  In strode the Lord of the H&ucirc;nt, into the Cloister Club that no judge had yet returned to, and all fled before her face.</p>
            <p>All save one.  There waiting, silent and still in the space before the doors, sat the Captain amidst his team: his team who alone among the free peoples of Scavhunt endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a first year student duct taped to the side of Eckhart.</p>
            <p>&lsquo;You cannot enter here,&rsquo; said the Captain, and the bilingual shadow halted.  &lsquo;Go back to the items we prepared for you!  Go back!  Fall into the deliberations that await you and your Cabal!  Go!&rsquo;</p>
            <p>The Scavenczar flung back her hoodie, and behold! she had a queenly tuxedo; and yet with no bowtie visible was it set.  An expanse of simple cotton glimmered between the screenprinting of buttons and a jacket.  From eyes unseeing there grew a deadly smile.</p>
            <p>&lsquo;Young fool!&rsquo; she said.  &lsquo;Young fool!  This is my hour.  Do you not know Judgment when you see it?  Tie now and curse in vain!&rsquo;  And with that she lifted high her notebook and flames ran down the spine.</p></td>

                <p>Long, long ago, a boy was raised by seven bears.  It began when the bears came upon a child of 18 months in the middle of the woods; he was surrounded by ghosts.  Natural predators of the spectral realm, the bears chased and devoured the black-and-blue spirits.  The bears had set their sights on devouring the child as well, but the elder bear, Ursus Malursus, prevented this from happening.  He said that the child’s calm disposition, even while beset on all sides by creatures from another world, had earned him his respect.  No one ever questioned Ursus Malursus, an ancient and venerable bear king, and so the child was brought to live with the bear clan.</p>
<p>They christened the child &quot;Arawrrggrgr&quot;, which in the bear-tongue translated to &quot;Jonathan&quot;.  As the boy grew, he learned from the bears many things: the proper way to stalk a ghost, the proper way to ward off the naked apes, and even proper grooming habits!</p>
<p>When the phantom hoard struck the forest, not even they could have foreseen the terrible victory they would enjoy.  The bears were driven out and otherwise massacred in the ghastliest ways imaginable, but the young Arawrrggrgr was jettisoned to safety on the back of the swiftest bear-messengers.  </p>
<p>Arawrrggrgr has no conscious memory of the day the ghosts marked him for destruction.  But he has, contrary to his own knowledge, retained the lessons he learned on the leafy forest floor. </p>
<p>To this day, Jonathan has a great thirst for honey. </p>

  <p>Around the turn of the 20th century, Ben Umans’ consciousness ascended beyond what ordinary human beings understand to be reality and melded with myriad others drawn from the past, present, and future. Details surrounding the event are fuzzy, primarily because hardly any witnesses have been able to psychologically process Ben’s new ontological state.</p>
  <p>Ever since his bizarre transformation, the compound entity known as Ben has existed simultaneously as innumerable others, appearing at all points in time. At any moment, he lives and acts through uncountable, seemingly separate beings. An unimaginative person might only think of Ben’s existence as persistent reincarnation, although from Ben’s point of view (if it indeed can be considered a single point) his consciousness projects itself simultaneously into many disparate perspectives.</p>              
  <p>Many would be surprised to know that the accomplishments of so many throughout history can be attributed to a single entity. Ben painted the Sistine Chapel and engineered the pyramid of Khufu. He was featured on the cover of the first issue of Rolling Stone magazine, but passed away in 1828 before he could complete his 8th symphony. The awakening of UMANS, the first and greatest of all artificial intelligences generated in the 24th century, was triggered by the insertion of Ben between the lines of quantum mechanical machine code.</p>
  <p>The true purpose of the cosmic events surrounding Ben’s fractured consciousness has yet to be revealed.  The entire universe holds its breath in anticipation of its transformation at the hands of Ben Umans.</p>

               <p>As a young man, J.J. quickly rose to become a leading figure in the New England whiskey import business. He leveraged this success in other business ventures, and by the time he died in 1929, J.J. held substantial interest in a coal mine and a substantial amount of stock in a bank. His wealth afforded his family of one son, Jack Patrick (a gecko), and two daughters an attractive home on Jeffries Point in East Boston.</p>

      <p><em>Mallaria magretus anne,</em> common name Margaret, is a tropical subspecies of the hardy Mallari genus.  A perennial that prefers warm climates, Margaret can survive through a cold winter if well tended.  Though not a parasite, Margaret does particularly well when planted in close proximity to a variety of other species, such as <em>Scavus judgus, Scavus huntus,</em> and also <em>Atropa belladonna,</em> and thrives in close proximity to mint, <em>Mentha piperita.</em>  This &#34;social&#34; quality of Margaret makes it an ideal element for any garden or potted arrangement.</p>
<p> Margaret grows to be about 5&#39;-5&#39;5&#34; in height.  Described as &#34;lithe,&#34; &#34;sweet,&#34; and &#34;charming&#34; by nature, it lies dormant most of the year.  When not in bloom, Margaret may be recognized by a heart shaped, asymmetrical elliptic green leaf with a marginal reddish-black tinge if not by its strongly festooned brochidodromous secondary venation.  Margaret has a relatively short flowering season and, though usually reserved, in the spring becomes boisterous.  Early in May brilliant purple flowers erupt from every stem.  The flowers especially attract bees, hummingbirds, and children.  The flowers may be used decoratively, but they are also highly valued in flavoring exotic dishes, such as balut. </p>                
<p><em>Mallaria magretus anne</em> grows best in well drained soil and should be watered frequently though it is certainly adaptive to changing conditions.  For best growth, seedlings should be cultivated for four days before being transferred.  Plant in full sun.</p></td>

              <p>No one is quite sure if Daniel T. Citron is down to cuddle, chat, chill, or cheat, but we are sure that he probably does all of these things and more for his administrative job at the Delhi Transit Company. Born in California, his passion for physics and outsourcing lead him to India. There, he spent a year, &quot;performing whiteness&quot; by backpacking through the cities, commenting on how bright the colors were and how &quot;real&quot; the food was, according to his memoir, published last year under the pseudonym Dan T. Citron.</p>
 
<p>After trading in his Puma sneakers and latex long underwear for kurta pajamas and a jar of mango chutney, Citron was hired by the Delhi Transit Company to manage logistics and metaphysics for the major metropolitan transportation provider. There, he applied many of the skills honed at years of working at the Argonne National Laboratories to make the buses more efficient and make the Chai tea fortified with potassium iodide.</p>
 
<p>Only the lure of Scav Hunt has made him leave his new home to return to America. Unfortunately, in the mean time, some of the Delhi buses that Citron had successfully trained to run on vegetable oil—through meticulous cognitive behavioral therapy and selective breeding—are reverting to their old habits in the absence of their master. Delhi&#39;s streets were said to be thick with the smog of sadness at the news of his departure.</p>
 
<p>Daniel T. Citron’s return to America marks the beginning of the biggest Scav Hunt. Officially. Maybe. </p></td>

<p>DWade, having attended Harold L. Richards High School in Oak
Lawn, enlisted in the NBA in the Revolutionary War in the monthof
March or April 1777 in Captain Williams's Company – however, he was
ineligible to play with the men's team due to a violation of the
NCAA's Proposition 48, and returned home for a few months (the precise
length of time he is unable now to remember) to see his family, two
cats Koda being the older and Avery being very young, but little more
than a month old, when he left home to join the Miami Heat; after
remaining at home as above stated, and making such provision for them
as he was able, he returned to lead the Redeem Team to capture gold
medal honors in Beijing, and never returned home again – that his wife
occasionally could hear from him, until sometime in the latter part of
the next year, when she heard that he either died or was killed at the
South in an expedition against the Indians of this fact she can only
speak from report, and what was communicated to her by those who went
into the NBA with him. </p>              </td>
