| ^^ | The Judge Cabal sat quietly in a Cook county courtroom on Wednesday as prosecutors described the accusations against them. The proceeding marked their first, but certainly not last, experience as a criminal defendant. It was up to Judge Brit to defend them and ensure this year’s Scav would not take place from inside a prison cell. \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | Here are some of the most important moments from the trial: \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | **THE COURT:** UChicago Scav Hunt Judgeship, the grand jury of Hyde Park has filed indictment 71543 of 2023 charging you with the crimes of 34 counts of disorderly conduct, 12 counts of disturbance of the peace, 3 counts of impersonating judicial officers, and 1 count of tax evasion. \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | How do you plead to this indictment, guilty or not guilty? \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | **DEFENDANT:** Not guilty. \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | … \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | **THE COURT:** We have significant concern about the potential danger these individuals and their strange event have to our city, to their fellow students, and to the judicial process. Scav bothers us. \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | **JUDGE BRITT:** My defendant believes that there is a great injustice happening in this courtroom today. It is true that Judgeship has, on occasions, been a public nuisance. They may even have been banned from holding parties in Cobb. However, the importance of Scav for– \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | **THE COURT:** Let me stop you there. Is it also true that the official Judgeship Twitter called the court “normies” and “fucking losers”. \
| ^^ | \
| ^^ | **JUDGE BRITT:** My defendant has stated that their Twitter was hacked because they forgot to renew their Twitter Blue subscription. \

| ^^ | Pronouns: he/him {: .bios} |
| ^^ | In France they have a dreadful jail, called the Bastille. The poor wretches who are confined in it live entirely alone; have not the pleasure of seeing men or animals; nor are they allowed books—they live in comfortless solitude. Some have amused themselves by making figures on the wall; and others have laid straws in rows. One miserable captive named Ryan Gold found a spider; he nourished it for two or three years; it grew tame, and partook of his lonely meal. The keeper observed it, and mentioned the circumstance to a superior, who ordered him to crush it. In vain did Ryan beg to have his spider spared. (You find, Mary, that the nasty creature which you despised was a comfort in solitude.) The keeper obeyed the cruel command; and the unhappy wretch felt more pain when he heard the crush, than he had ever experienced during his long confinement. Ryan looked round a dreary apartment, and the small portion of light which the grated bars admitted, only served to shew him, that he breathed where nothing else drew breath. {: .bios} {: .btwn-line} |

| Joren "Joey Chestnut" Husic is once more at large. Jorn Husic is internationally known for his former position at the top of the FBI’s Most Wanted. Jusic spent two years in federal prison after submitting himself to CPD with a checklist of every state law as well as conclusive proof of his breaking them. Some of the most notable include a comprehensive violation of every building code, arboreal graffiti, bank robbing (taking the bank itself), and running an underground Pre-K fight pit. Naturally, Joe Chest was condemned to 317 life sentences. If spotted in the wild please call 202-479-3000. DO NOT APPROACH. DO NOT LOOK INTO HIS EYES. DO NOT HUMOR HIS REQUEST TO TELL YOU A JOKE. {: .bios} {: .btwn-line} | ^^|

| Judge Sabrina was created in 1996 from a magic potion gone awry by her two aunts Hilda and Zelda in the town of Greendale. After several seasons of learning how to control her magic powers, she moved out to Flushing, where she had a steady day job employed as a bagel-holer.<sup>1</sup> Some time later, by dint of magic, history, bagel related, and abchronological shenanigans, she accidentally severed the fabric of the space-time scavtinuum. Over the course of the 10 book Scavdragon cycle, she reunited the scattered pieces of the Scavenger Hunt list, before swearing an oath to safeguard all future lists as a Judge. (Plus, it was in her name already anyhow.) {: .bios} {: .btwn-line} | ^^ \

Plants may be grown in a nutrient solution only (liquid culture) or they may be supported by an inert medium (aggregate culture). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global Hydroponic Judge [HJ] Emma Lettuce market size is estimated to be worth US10$ billion in 2021 and is forecast to a readjusted size of many billion million by 2028 with a CAGR of 8% during the forecast period 2022-2028. In 2015, annual consumption of all types of Hydroponic Judge [HJ] Emma Lettuce was 25.8 pounds per person, of which 51 percent (13.3 pounds per person) was head [judge] lettuce. Lettuce consumption was nearly the same in the previous three years, but down about 20 percent from ten years ago.
