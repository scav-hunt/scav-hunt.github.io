# Code of Conduct

***This document is intended to address behaviors that the Judgeship will not tolerate and modes of recourse and possible in-Scav consequences for such behaviors. This is in addition to the guidelines set out by the Rules of the Hunt and University policy.***

## Section 1: Responsibility
It is expected that no participant of The Great Hunt, Judge or otherwise, will exhibit gross misconduct or behavior that is inappropriately detrimental to Scavvies, Judges, outsiders, or Scav Hunt as a whole. Some examples of inappropriate behavior specifically targeted by this policy include, but are not limited to: hazing, bullying, harassment, discrimination, aiding and abetting, collusion, sabotage, and inappropriately making the Hunt worse for others. Such behavior can take place in public Scav spaces like events, in intra- and inter-team interactions, and/or in forums such as the Discord and email listhosts. Note that "being an unlikeable prick" does not *necessarily* fall under this rule, but it can at the discretion of the Judges.

## Section 2: Our Domain
The Judge Cabal serves to facilitate the Scav Hunt, and while we hope all Scavvies have a wonderful time, our reach and power is limited, particularly with regard to conflicts within teams or between individual Scavvies. It is the Judgeship’s responsibility to deal with misconduct by Judges; for misconduct by Scavvies, the Judges are only one recourse of several. There are existing resources that are more empowered to deal with shit than we are. 

## Section 3: Appropriate Channels

### Section 3-A: Things We (The Judges) Would Like to Know About
- Cheating
- Misconduct (as defined in Section 1) that occurs without Judges present
- Misconduct by Judges

There will be one Judge who is responsible for handling Code of Conduct violations. The name and contact information of that Judge will be placed in this document prior to the Hunt. If you are attempting to report a Code of Conduct violation by that very same Judge, contact the Head Judge instead. For reasons of impartiality, reports to other Judges will be redirected.

### Section 3-B: What We (The Judges)'ll Do About It
- Should a Judge exhibit any misbehavior/misconduct, we will:
    - Follow up to discuss with relevant parties
    - If necessary, disallow their participation in the remainder of the Hunt
    - In extreme cases, expel them from the Cabal and report to the Administration 
- Should we witness a participant exhibiting any misbehavior/misconduct, we may:
    - Ask them to leave the area
    - Restrict them from Scav spaces
    - Revoke relevant Scav privileges (see Section 4)
    - Contact Captains
    - In extreme cases, report to the Administration
- Should we witness or have reports of a team exhibiting collective misbehavior/misconduct, we may:
    - Issue a warning to Captains
    - Deduct points should the behavior be related to an Item
    - Revoke relevant Scav privileges (see Section 4)
    - In extreme cases, immediately disqualify the team

### Section 3-C: Things Your Captains Should Know About
- Intrateam conflicts
- Fires
- How unfair you think pointing is, or how impossible an item is, et cetera

### Section 3-D: Things You Might Want to Tell Your RA/RH/RD/Retc. About, If You’re in a Dorm
- Your Captains are being jerks
- Your teammates are being jerks, and your Captains aren't doing anything about it

### Section 3-E: Things the Administration Should Know About
- Serious Shit. We have to report it, and so do you. We encourage you to reach out to the Cabal or your residential staff if you need assistance with reporting.
