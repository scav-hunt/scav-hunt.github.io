Count Will of Epstein (ᴏᴄ) is the last count of that name. Not only will Will inhabit the Castle, but for the next twenty-five years Will will never leave it. Will will work with the preparatory commission before joining the secretariat the next year. Will will be a rich and kaleidoscopic piece, with the promise of something truly intoxicating. A distant clatter scratches at the surface, stirring an otherwise soft and simple Will. The small disturbance—like a Will-rattled porch door—will will Will into the room with you. Will will be a noble and handsome old individual, every movement betokening a proud dignity and a touching benevolence, with a white head that seems, in the words of Schiller, “crowned by holy deeds.” Will will be an aggressive advocate for the cause of universal peace.
