Long-time viewers of the Sabrina Sternberg Show know that there’s one thing that Sabrina fears above all else: the killer. Sabrina has made multiple mentions of the unknown, faceless killer she believes lies in wait for us all and has even shared her own peculiar tactics for dealing with the constant threat. Twitter users have had an especially fun time with this rediscovered quirk of Sabrina’s. 

A compilation video of Sabrina discussing “the killer” on her talk show has gone viral, and the Twitter reactions to Sabrina’s long and storied obsession have been hilarious. For those who don’t know, “the killer” is essentially a horror movie-style villain who creeps up on you when you least expect it and lurks in dark, hidden corners.  

Sabrina has long made her fear of the killer known on her talk show, so much so that guests have commented on her morbid fascination. In order to thwart the killer, Sabrina has a number of tricks up her sleeve. She’s mentioned the bat she keeps in her nightstand at the ready in case there’s an intruder. In true Sabrina fashion, the bat is bedazzled with pink rhinestones and covered in metallic spikes, the perfect fusion of deadly and chic.
