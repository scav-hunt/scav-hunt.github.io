it was many and many a year ago \\
in a town that starts with C \\
that a scavver there lived whom you may know \\
by the name of artemie \\
and this scavver lived with no other thought \\
than to judge, and judge duly  

i wrote items and they wrote items  \\
in this city that starts with C \\
but we judged with a judge that was more than judgy- \\
i and great artemie- \\
with points that the imbued power of CLI \\
covered them and me

and that was the reason that, long ago,  \\
in this city that starts with C \\
crafts were borne from chemistry, inspiring \\
the crocheting Artemie; \\
so that the lull of writing came \\
and bore them away from me; \\
to employ them in the JFI \\
in this city that starts with C
