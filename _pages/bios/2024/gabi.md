[2004 - Gabi is back on the freighter.]

GABI: —trust me.

DAVID: I do trust you. But you still have to remember that number.

GABI: 7946-0893. [repeating] It's a London number.

DAVID: Excellent timing... the patch is done, but I don't know how long the battery will last. I hope he’s there.

GABI: I hope so too.

[The phone rings, the sound playing over the 1996 scene when Gabi leaves Garfield’s home. He briefly looks down at her from a second-story window before closing the drapes. After several rings, someone answers.]

GARFIELD: Hello?

GABI: Garfield?

GARFIELD: Gabi?

[The scene briefly changes to 1996 when Gabi is walking away from Garfield’s]

GABI: Garfield… Garfield, you answered. You answered, Garfield.

[In London, Garfield is at home standing by a Christmas tree.]

GARFIELD: Gabs, where are you?

GABI: I'm... I'm, I'm on a boat. Um... I've been on an island, and— Oh my god, Garfield. Is that really you?

GARFIELD: Yeah! Yes, it's me!

GABI: You believe me? You still care about me?

GARFIELD: Gabs, I've been looking for you for the past three years. I know about the island. I've been researching---[static]---and then when I spoke to your friend Cole, that's when I knew you were still alive. That's when I knew I wasn't crazy. Gabs, are you still there!?

GABI: Yes, yes, I'm here! I'm still here, can you hear me?

GARFIELD: Yeah, yeah, that's better.

GABI: I love you, Garfield. I've always loved you. I'm so sorry. I love you.

GARFIELD: I love you too.

GABI: I don't know where I am, but—

GARFIELD: I'll find you, Gabs—

GABI: —I promise—

GARFIELD: —no matter what—

GABI: —I'll come back to you—

GARFIELD: —I won't give up—

BOTH: I promise. I love you.

[Static cuts them off.]

DAVID: I'm sorry. The power source went dead, it's all we have.

[Gabi walks toward David, her memory of her and her time on the island returning.]

GABI: Thank you, David. [They shake hands] It was enough.

DAVID: Are you alright now?

GABI: Aye. I'm perfect.
