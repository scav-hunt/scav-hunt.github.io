In France they have a dreadful jail, called the Bastille. The poor wretches who are confined in it live entirely alone; have not the pleasure of seeing men or animals; nor are they allowed booksâ€”they live in comfortless solitude. Some have amused themselves by making figures on the wall; and others have laid straws in rows. One miserable captive named Ryan Gold found a spider; he nourished it for two or three years; it grew tame, and partook of his lonely meal. The keeper observed it, and mentioned the circumstance to a superior, who ordered him to crush it. In vain did Ryan beg to have his spider spared. (You find, Mary, that the nasty creature which you despised was a comfort in solitude.) The keeper obeyed the cruel command; and the unhappy wretch felt more pain when he heard the crush, than he had ever experienced during his long confinement. Ryan looked round a dreary apartment, and the small portion of light which the grated bars admitted, only served to shew him, that he breathed where nothing else drew breath.
