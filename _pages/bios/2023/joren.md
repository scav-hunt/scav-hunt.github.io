Joren "Joey Chestnut" Husic is once more at large. Jorn Husic is internationally known for his former position at the top of the FBIâ€™s Most Wanted. Jusic spent two years in federal prison after submitting himself to CPD with a checklist of every state law as well as conclusive proof of his breaking them. Some of the most notable include a comprehensive violation of every building code, arboreal graffiti, bank robbing (taking the bank itself), and running an underground Pre-K fight pit. Naturally, Joe Chest was condemned to 317 life sentences. If spotted in the wild please call 202-479-3000. DO NOT APPROACH. DO NOT LOOK INTO HIS EYES. DO NOT HUMOR HIS REQUEST TO TELL YOU A JOKE.
