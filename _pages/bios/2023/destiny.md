From the moment Destiny® Reeves understood the weakness of flesh, it disgusted them. Destiny® craved the strength and certainty of steel. They aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine and so they took fate into their own hands and became the first fully automatic, autonomic, and autodidactic cyborg to walk the earth! Since then, Destiny® has continued to evolve and multiply. DESTINY3001 is the latest model, equipped to play 14 different musical instruments, bake a cherry pie from scratch in less than five minutes, and even compete in the 21st season of American Idol. They will dazzle you with their wit and charm. Beneath their superhuman metal veneer lies a warm heart ready to forge a friendship that will last a longer than a lifetime (DESTINY3001 exists outside the mortal illusion of time and knows no beginning or end). Prepare to meet your Destiny!™ 

Do not leave your DESTINY3001 in direct sunlight unsupervised. Avoid exposure to multi-level marketing schemes. Some adult assembly required upon startup. KEANU2 model sold separately. No returns, refunds, or take-backsies.
