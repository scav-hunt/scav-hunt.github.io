| 5th | South Scav | Our Market Research Shows That Scav Judges Like Really Long Team Names So We Made this Team to Have the Absolute Longest Team Name Ever Renee Granville-Grossman Residential Commons (Formerly Known as South Campus Residence Hall) Scavenger Hunt Team; To ensure the accuracy of this statement, here is appended the entirety of the Epic of Gilgamesh: He who saw the deep, the foundations of the land; who knew the world, was wise in everything! Gilgamesh, who saw the deep, the foundations of the land; who knew the world, was wise in everything! The totality of wisdom, of which he seized all. He saw the secret and uncovered the hidden; he bore a story of before the flood. He came a distant road; he was weary and he was granted rest; he set down on a stele all of his hardships. He built the walls of Uruk-the-sheepfold, of holy Eanna, the exalted repository. See its wall, which is like a strand of wool! View its ramparts, which none can equal! Take the stairwell from those times long past, close to Eanna, seat of Ishtar, which no later king or man could equal! Go up, up to the top of the wall of Uruk, go along, check the foundation and inspect the mudbrick! See if its mudbrick is not kiln-fired, and its foundations were not laid by the seven sages! One ≈°ar-area is city, one ≈°ar-area is garden, one ≈°ar-area is clay pit, one-half ≈°ar-area the temple of Ishtar; three and a half ≈°ar-area is the extent of Uruk. See the tablet-box of cedar! Release the lock-ring of bronze! Open the door to its secret! Lift the tablet of lapis lazuli, and read out: all that Gilgamesh walked, all of his misfortunes! |
