The purpose of the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt... is actually a matter of some debate. A more extensive disquisition on our ontological orientation may be found in our [Bylaws]({{site.url}}/bore), but this much we know: every May, since 1987, the University of Chicago has hosted the largest and best scavenger hunt in the world. Spanning four days, the Hunt is an intense blend of bliss and chaos. The modern Hunt includes a list of items and events, Scav Olympics, and a blood drive benefiting the University of Chicago Medical Center, though the precise form and content evolves from year to year.

Participants and observers know that ScavHunt is a BFD. It is fun, it is brilliant, it is deeply U. of C., and it seems to bring out the best in all of us in unexpected ways. It is occasionally disgusting. But it is in the nature of Scav to be essentially indescribable, and lest you be taken in by all this touchy-feely talk we reference Potter Stewart somewhat freely in saying you'll know it when you see it, so take a look.

In case that doesn't satisfy your unquenchable thirst for knowledge, check out some [frequently asked questions]({{site.url}}/lore).
